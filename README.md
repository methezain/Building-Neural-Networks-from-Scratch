I just took a simple playlist from youtube teaching about Artificial Neural Networks from scratch. 
What I actually did:
-> Understood the basics of Python libraries like pandas and numpy 
-> Understood the concepts of basic neurons, and layer of neurons
-> Inputs, Neurons, Layers, Outputs, Loss 
-> Forward Pass in ANNs
-> Backward Pass in ANNs
-> Understood how important is dot product, Activation functions, and Partial Derivatives

After understanding whole theory, just tried to run this code, and it is successully OK.
So, I can say, I now have built a foundation of Artificial Neural Networks and the mathematics behind it.
